Hi, I'm Hannah, an atmospheric scientist, based in Palmerston North, New Zealand. I am currently working towards a PhD through The University of Auckland.

My research focuses on using a LiDAR ceilometer instrument to investigate the structure and dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer over Auckland City. My project aims to develop a climatology of boundary layer characteristics, examine the underlying processes which drive boundary layer variability, and explore the influence of the boundary layer on air pollution.

You can read my latest publication 'A Ceilometer-Derived Climatology of the Convective Boundary Layer Over a Southern Hemisphere Subtropical City' [here](https://rdcu.be/caPxW).
