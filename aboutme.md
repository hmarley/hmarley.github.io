Hi, I'm Hannah, an atmospheric scientist, based in Palmerston North, New Zealand. I am currently working towards a PhD through The University of Auckland. My research focuses on using a LiDAR ceilometer instrument to investigate the structure and dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer over Auckland City. My project aims to develop a climatology of boundary layer characteristics, examine the underlying processes which drive boundary layer variability, and explore the influence of the boundary layer on air pollution.
