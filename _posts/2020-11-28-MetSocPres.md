The annual Meteorological Society conference for 2020 was held at Canterbury University. I gave a presention in the student session, with my talk based on some key findings from my latest publication "A Ceilometer-Derived Climatology of the Convective Boundary Layer Over a Southern Hemisphere Subtropical City". I won third place for my oral presentation. You can view the slides from my presentation using the link below.
