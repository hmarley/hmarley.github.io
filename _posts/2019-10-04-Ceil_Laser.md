Today, with the help of the techncian, I installed a new laser in the ceilometer instrument that I get the data for boundary layer estimation from. The old laser had stopped working properly and the instrument was no longer recording good quality data. The process was a lot easier than I expected and we not have beautiful high resolution vertical profiles being recorded with the new laser!

Here is a photo of inside the ceilometer and a photo of the old laser:
